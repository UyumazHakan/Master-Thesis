\section{Background}
Internet of Things (IoT) has become an emerging technology with the power of low priced computational units and cloud technology. There are thousands of different examples in the real world which are aiming both end-users and industry. To achieve such applications or prototypes of these applications, hundreds or thousands working hours should be spent by software developers to implement both embedded software and web services to work for their needs. 

In most cases, the applications have similar capability needs in their required web-services with some little customization. The most basic capabilities that any web services should have can be listed as;
\begin{itemize}
  \item Receiving data,
  \item Serving data,
  \item Applying rules on gathered data when an event occurs,
  \item User authentication and authorization,
  \item Data isolation.
\end{itemize}
 Furthermore, they may need to support multiple protocols at the same time for accessing and modifying same data since these web services are used by different platforms. Although multiple protocols are used at the same time, choice of protocols is always similar. 

 To receive data from a constrained network and/or node, Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) is preferred. as their web-services such as CoAP, MQTT and HTTP with REST architecture. 

 The common trait of all these protocols is being highly generic to support any needs ofthe developer on their communication through the internet. On the other hand, the required functionalities of web services that are used in are of IoT are diverged from each other with only little differences. Interoperability of sensors, actuators, machine to machine (M2M) communcation and context-aware services is the main concern of IoT \cite{6651222}. Therefore, a Platform as a Service can be defined to develop own custom web services in IoT domain by using predefined and parameterized building blocks in order to give developers a fast and practical environment to work on.

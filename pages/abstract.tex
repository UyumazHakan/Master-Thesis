%TODO: Abstract
In the current technology state of the world, internet acts as the central hub for all kinds of communication between different nodes. Regardless of the subject, all types of software use web services that are built with their own well-defined, high-level and abstract web service architectures to accomplish this communication with each other. The architecture that will be used to build the system communication can differ in terms of needs. Plenty of different architectures and protocols exists to build web services. Nevertheless, the choices would always be the same for the similar work field since constraints that should be satisfied by the web services will be alike. Moreover, the architecture design of these technologies will also be very similar.

The web services in the Internet of Things (IoT) are also defined in a very similar way and mostly based on REST, CoAP or MQTT. The programmers who are building IoT web services are dealing with implementation of the same functionalities with a little difference under this similarity. However, these differences can be parameterized. Therefore, the programmers will only require to configure their system in a high-level perspective. These configurations will consist of the information about the user devices,  protocols, how data is stored and how data is processed.

The aim of this thesis is to build a rule engine to esaily configure required functionalities of web services in IoT domain. A rule can be applied on data streams are received from the devices or the data batches to process histroical data of a device or devices. By achieving this goal, an easy-to-use -with high-level configuration- development environment in the domain of IoT will be introduced. These high-level configuratons can either be done in a user-friendly web interface or through an application program interface. Therefore, the gap between high-level design and actual low level implementation will be covered with the rules that are configured by the users to match their design.
